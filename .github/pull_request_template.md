# Notes

- What did you find easy?

- What did you find hard?
I didn't finished yet but for now I found hard to define what height and width assign to each element. I also think that setting the media queries and how to work fine with position absolute relative and fixed are kind of difficult too

- What do you still not understand?

- Any other notes?
